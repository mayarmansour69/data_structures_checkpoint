For problem 1 i write an algorithm that find the sum of all distinct elements from the set. In other words, find the sum of all elements which are present in either of the given set.


For problem 2 i write a procedure that calculates in the variable ps, the dot(scalar) product of v1 and v2 (v1 and v2 are vectors of IR) and 
Write an algorithm which determines, for n pairs of given vectors, whether two vectors of given IR are orthogonal, by calling the procedure defined in the previous question.
